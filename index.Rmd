# My Website

Hello and welcome to my website!  My name is Sean McWhirter and I'm from Minneapolis, MN.  

This page will display my work as I progress through the Data Science program at SMU.

There is not much on here yet, but take a look around.  On this page you will find:

Case Study 1: This is the R Markdown file for the first case study.

Case Study 2:  Here you will find the RMD file for the second case study.
